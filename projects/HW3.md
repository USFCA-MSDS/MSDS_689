# Enhanced Graph k-Means Implementation and Optimization
## Description:
In this task, you will extend the provided [Graph K-Means](https://github.com/USFCA-MSDS/MSDS_689/blob/main/notebooks/graphkmeans.ipynb) algorithm by exploring variations such as different centrality measures, initialization algorithms, and optimization strategies. Additionally, you will conduct experimental studies to analyze the algorithm's running time and efficiency. Your goal is to optimize the [base model](https://github.com/USFCA-MSDS/MSDS_689/blob/main/notebooks/graphkmeans.ipynb)  and compare its performance against your custom implementation.




## Task Overview:

* (1) Experiment with alternative centrality measures available in NetworkX, such as betweenness centrality or eigenvector centrality. Evaluate their effectiveness in determining cluster centers.


* (2) Initialization Algorithms: Explore different initialization strategies for selecting initial cluster centers. Compare their impact on convergence and clustering quality.
Experimental Analysis:


* (3) Conduct experimental studies to analyze the running time and efficiency of the [base Graph K-Means algorithm](https://github.com/USFCA-MSDS/MSDS_689/blob/main/notebooks/graphkmeans.ipynb). Vary the size and density of input graphs to assess scalability and performance under different conditions.


* (4) Code Optimization: Optimize the provided [base model](https://github.com/USFCA-MSDS/MSDS_689/blob/main/notebooks/graphkmeans.ipynb) for improved efficiency and computational speed. Consider algorithmic optimizations, data structure improvements, and parallelization techniques to enhance performance.


* (5) Custom Implementation: Using the [base model](https://github.com/USFCA-MSDS/MSDS_689/blob/main/notebooks/graphkmeans.ipynb) develop your optimaized/custom Graph K-Means algorithm, incorporating insights gained from variations exploration and code optimization. Ensure adherence to PEP 8 standards and maintain comprehensive unit tests for code validation.


* (6) Performance Comparison: Compare the running time and efficiency of your custom implementation against the [base model](https://github.com/USFCA-MSDS/MSDS_689/blob/main/notebooks/graphkmeans.ipynb). Conduct rigorous experimentation across various datasets to validate performance improvements.
