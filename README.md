MSDS689 Data Structures and Algorithms
=======

This course is part of the [MS in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science).

The goal is to give students a deeper and more general view of data structures and algorithms. While students have examined a number of data structures, such as binary trees, already, this course provides a much more in-depth study. This depth will benefit them greatly in the advanced machine learning course. This course also tends to address many of the difficult algorithm questions students get during job interviews. The critical data structures covered in this class are: lists, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, and tries. The course also covers a variety of common and useful recursive and non-recursive algorithms, such as searching and sorting.


# Course Learning Objectives (CLOs)

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Describe object-oriented programming and use objects to construct linked lists, trees, and graph data structures
2. Understand the fundamental data structures such as hashtables, disjoint union, stack and queue.
3. Analyze and compare algorithmic complexity using “big-O” notation
4. Apply classical algorithms and data structure to problems in data science.
   



# Class details

**INSTRUCTOR.** [Mustafa Hajij](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/mustafa-hajij).

<!--
* My office is room 607 @ 101 Howard
-->


Lectures are Friday 


**INSTRUCTION FORMAT**. Class runs for 1:50 hours 1 day/week. Instructor-student interaction during lecture is encouraged and we'll mix in mini-exercises / labs during class. All programming will be done in the Python 3 programming language, unless otherwise specified.

**TARDINESS.** Please be on time for class. It is a big distraction if you come in late.
