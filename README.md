MSDS689 Data Structures and Algorithms
=======

This course is part of the [MS in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science).

The goal is to give students a deeper and more general view of data structures and algorithms. While students have examined a number of data structures, such as binary trees, already, this course provides a much more in-depth study. This depth will benefit them greatly in the advanced machine learning course. This course also tends to address many of the difficult algorithm questions students get during job interviews. The critical data structures covered in this class are: lists, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, and tries. The course also covers a variety of common and useful recursive and non-recursive algorithms, such as searching and sorting.


At the end of the last module, we studied feature importance and briefly touched on clustering.  There was not time to study these topics in more detail through projects, but they are important and students report getting related interview questions extremely frequently. Consequently, while seemingly a bit out of place, the faculty has decided to include free-form reports on these machine-learning related topics in this data structures and algorithms class. Here are two quick comments I received from the last cohort concerning these projects:


# Course Learning Objectives (CLOs)

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Describe object-oriented programming and use objects to construct linked lists, trees, and graph data structures
2. Identify the essential logic and algorithms in the code of others
3. Implement critical algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and list manipulations
4. Design recursive algorithms
5. Analyze and compare algorithmic complexity using “big-O” notation



# Class details

**INSTRUCTOR.** [Mustafa Hajij](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/mustafa-hajij).

<!--
* My office is room 607 @ 101 Howard

Lectures are Friday 


**INSTRUCTION FORMAT**. Class runs for 1:50 hours 1 day/week. Instructor-student interaction during lecture is encouraged and we'll mix in mini-exercises / labs during class. All programming will be done in the Python 3 programming language, unless otherwise specified.

**TARDINESS.** Please be on time for class. It is a big distraction if you come in late.

Note: In order to pass this course, students are expected to receive at least 50% of each category. E.g., receiving less than 29/60 on your quiz might not be a satisfying grade.

The oohtable project will be graded with the specific input or tests given in the project description, so you understand precisely what is expected of your program. (There are a few hidden tests though.) Consequently, projects will be graded in binary fashion: The tests either work or they do not. The only exception is when your program does not run on the grader's or my machine because of some cross-platform issue. This is typically because a student has hardcoded some file name or directory into their program. In that case, we will take off *a minimum* of 10% instead of giving you a 0, depending on the severity of the mistake. Please go to github and verify that the website has the proper files for your solution. That is what I will download for testing.

Each project has a hard deadline and only those projects working correctly before the deadline get credit.  My grading script pulls from github at the deadline.  *All projects are due at the start of class on the day indicated, unless otherwise specified.*

**Grading standards**. I consider an **A** grade to be above and beyond what most students have achieved. A **B** grade is an average grade for a student or what you could call "competence" in a business setting. A **C** grade means that you either did not or could not put forth the effort to achieve competence. Below **C** implies you did very little work or had great difficulty with the class compared to other students.
