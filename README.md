MSDS689 Data Structures and Algorithms
=======

This course is part of the [MS in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science).

The goal is to give students a deeper and more general view of data structures and algorithms. While students have examined a number of data structures, such as binary trees, already, this course provides a much more in-depth study. This depth will benefit them greatly in the advanced machine learning course. This course also tends to address many of the difficult algorithm questions students get during job interviews. The critical data structures covered in this class are: lists, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, and tries. The course also covers a variety of common and useful recursive and non-recursive algorithms, such as searching and sorting.


At the end of the last module, we studied feature importance and briefly touched on clustering.  There was not time to study these topics in more detail through projects, but they are important and students report getting related interview questions extremely frequently. Consequently, while seemingly a bit out of place, the faculty has decided to include free-form reports on these machine-learning related topics in this data structures and algorithms class. Here are two quick comments I received from the last cohort concerning these projects:


# Course Learning Objectives (CLOs)

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Describe object-oriented programming and use objects to construct linked lists, trees, and graph data structures
2. Understand the fundamental data structures such as hashtables, disjoint union, stack and queue.
3. Analyze and compare algorithmic complexity using “big-O” notation
4. Apply classical algorithms and data structure to problems in data science.
   



# Class details

**INSTRUCTOR.** [Mustafa Hajij](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/mustafa-hajij).

<!--
* My office is room 607 @ 101 Howard
-->


Lectures are Friday 


**INSTRUCTION FORMAT**. Class runs for 1:50 hours 1 day/week. Instructor-student interaction during lecture is encouraged and we'll mix in mini-exercises / labs during class. All programming will be done in the Python 3 programming language, unless otherwise specified.

**TARDINESS.** Please be on time for class. It is a big distraction if you come in late.

## Student evaluation

| Artifact | Grade Weight | Due date |
|--------|--------|--------|
|HW1| 8% | Sat, Feb 3 11:59pm |
|HW2| 17% | Sat, Feb 24 11:59pm |
|HW3| 18% | Sat Mar 2 11:59pm |
|Exam 1| 25%| Th Feb 15 |
|Exam 2| 25%| Fri Mar 8 |
|Attendance and participation | 7%| attend _all_ lectures and actively participate in class  |


Note: In order to pass this course, students are expected to receive at least 50% of each category. E.g., receiving less than 29/60 on your HW might not be a satisfying grade.


# Review and Resources

Here is a great free book on [algorithms by Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/).

A great book that is not free is here [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=introduction+to+algorithms&qid=1674784191&sprefix=introduction+t%2Caps%2C174&sr=8-1)
